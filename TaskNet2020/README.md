# TaskNet Saliency Model
TaskNet Model is a task-driven saliency model that aims to predict road traffic incidents. This model outputs a saliency map that simulates the eye fixation of a human and represents the visual saliency on road traffic scenarios. 

The model has three architectures integrated with different Deep Neural Networks pre-trained for object detection, specifically VGG16, GoogLeNet22, and ResNet50. Each architecture is fine-tuned using three variations of the TaskFix dataset, which is available at this **[link](https://tinyurl.com/TaskFix2020)**. The model has a total of nine versions, caffemodels can be downloaded **[here](https://tinyurl.com/TaskNetCaffemodels)**.
